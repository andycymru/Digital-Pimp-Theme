Since moving my website from wordpress i've slowly developed techniques that were originally second nature. I mainly updated my website via the wordpress app on my phone so moving to [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com "Jekyll") i didn't know an app even existed. well.... one does. It's called 'octopage' and does exactly what the wordpress app does but develops jekyll pages instead.

The app is brilliant, as it means we can write articles on the move. You can also amend your pages markdown so your content doesnt break. fantastic stuff!
