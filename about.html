<p><span>I'm Andy Brown. I am a designer &amp; front-end developer at <a href="http://www.imsofunky.com" alt="ImSoFunky" target="_blank">ImSoFunky</a></br>
	where I am currently undertaking creative projects full-time.</span></p>

<p>I am generally found drawing or creating websites, designing artwork and graphics for businesses in print or online, or I am designing/making animated movies for youtube. Either way its using skills I have honed for over 10 years and I love every minute of my job. <!--<a href="http://www.imsofunky.com/portfolio/" alt="">See my portfolio</a> over at ImSoFunky.--></p>

<p>Before working at <a href="http://www.imsofunky.com" alt="im so funky" target="_blank">ImSoFunky</a> I studied information tech, maths and english at <a href="http://www.stdavidscollege.ac.uk" alt="St Davids College" target="_blank">St Davids College</a>, Cardiff. Then I went on to <a href="http://www.southwales.ac.uk" alt="University of Glamorgan" target="_blank">University of Glamorgan</a> (Now University of South Wales) where I studied a degree in 'Information Tech' and gained further skills and tools to create what I use in my projects.</p>

<p>Outside of designing I enjoy writing. I used to write for <a href="http://www.bluesandsoul.com" alt="Blues and Soul" target="_blank">Blues &amp; Soul Magazine</a> when it was a printed magazine. It has since closed and reformed to an online blog only. I also love to get distracted by sports and I am ofen found playing and coaching sledge hockey for <a href="http://www.cardiffhuskies.com" alt="Cardiff Huskies" target="_blank">Cardiff Huskies sledge hockey team</a>. Which is a version of ice hockey for athletes with a disability. I am also a keen rugby fan, I can often be found supporting my home teams <a href="http://www.cardiffblues.com" alt="Cardiff Blues" target="_blank">Cardiff Blues</a> and <a href="http://www.wru.wales" alt="WRU Welsh Rugby Union" target="_blank">Wales</a>.</p>

<p>A personal goal for this year is to speak fluently in my native language of Welsh. Something I regret not continuing since school. So  I have joined up with <a href="http://www.learnwelsh.co.uk" alt="Learn Welsh for Adults" target="_blank">Welsh For Adults</a> at <a href="http://www.cardiff.ac.uk" alt="Cardiff University" target="_blank">Cardiff University</a> and I am looking forward to speaking the language properly and maybe publishing some blog posts yn Gymraeg (in welsh) in the future.</p>
